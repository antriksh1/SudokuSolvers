Description:

Solves Sudokus with 3 approaches:

VERY SLOW:
1. Simple Backtracking (1..9)

SLOW:
2. Reduced Domain Backtracking (Only values which satisfy initial grid constraints)

VERY FAST:
3. Constraint Propagation Backtracking (Updates possibilities for each cell as we go)

The fastest approach is based on Peter Norvig's approach at: http://norvig.com/sudoku.html
